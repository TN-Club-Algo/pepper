# pepper

Pepper's goal is to manage the untrusted code execution on AlgoTN's platform.<br>
It is divided in two parts : pepper which manages each VM and the tests it is executing, and pepper-vm which is present inside each VM to interact with the user's program and send the program output outside the VM.
